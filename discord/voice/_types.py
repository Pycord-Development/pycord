    .. warning::

        If you are a end user, you **should not construct this manually** but instead
        take it from the return type in :meth:`abc.Connectable.connect <VoiceChannel.connect>`.
        The parameters and methods being documented here is so third party libraries can refer to it
        when implementing their own VoiceProtocol types.

    This is an abstract class. The library provides a concrete implementation
    under :class:`VoiceClient`.

    This class allows you to implement a protocol to allow for an external
    method of sending voice, such as Lavalink_ or a native library implementation.

    These classes are passed to :meth:`abc.Connectable.connect <VoiceChannel.connect>`.

    .. _Lavalink: https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink

    Parameters
    ----------
    client: :class:`Client`
        The client (or its subclasses) that started the connection request.
    channel: :class:`abc.Connectable`
        The voice channel that is being connected to.

            The voice state payload.

        raise NotImplementedError

    async def connect(self, *, timeout: float, reconnect: bool) -> None:
        """|coro|

        A method called to initialise the connection.

        The library initialises this class and calls ``__init__``, and then :meth:`connect` when attempting
        to start a connection to the voice. If an error ocurrs, it calls :meth:`disconnect`, so if you need
        to implement any cleanup, you should manually call it in :meth:`disconnect` as the library will not
        do so for you.

        Within this method, to start the voice connection flow, it is recommened to use :meth:`Guild.change_voice_state`
        to start the flow. After which :meth:`on_voice_server_update` and :meth:`on_voice_state_update` will be called,
        although this could vary and cause unexpected behaviour, but that falls under Discord's way of handling the voice
        connection.

        Parameters
        ----------
        timeout: :class:`float`
            The timeout for the connection.
        reconnect: :class:`bool`
            Whether reconnection is expected.

    async def disconnect(self, *, force: bool) -> None:

        A method called to terminate the voice connection.

        This can be either called manually when forcing a disconnection, or when an exception in :meth:`connect` ocurrs.

        It is recommended to call :meth:`cleanup` here.

        Parameters
        ----------
        force: :class:`bool`
            Whether the disconnection was forced.

        It is advisable to call this from within :meth:`disconnect` when you are completely
        done with the voice protocol instance.

        This method removes it from the internal state cache that keeps track of the currently
        alive voice clients. Failure to clean-up will cause subsequent connections to report that
        it's still connected.

        **The library will NOT automatically call this for you**, unlike :meth:`connect` and :meth:`disconnect`.
