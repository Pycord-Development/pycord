    """|coro|

    Attempts to get an attribute from the object in cache. If it fails, it will attempt to fetch it.
    If the fetch also fails, an error will be raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj: Any
        The object to use the get or fetch methods in
    attr: :class:`str`
        The attribute to get or fetch. Note the object must have both a ``get_`` and ``fetch_`` method for this attribute.
    id: :class:`int`
        The ID of the object
    default: Any
        The default value to return if the object is not found, instead of raising an error.

    Returns
    -------
    Any
        The object found or the default value.

    Raises
    ------
    :exc:`AttributeError`
        The object is missing a ``get_`` or ``fetch_`` method
    :exc:`NotFound`
        Invalid ID for the object
    :exc:`HTTPException`
        An error occurred fetching the object
    :exc:`Forbidden`
        You do not have permission to fetch the object

    Examples
    --------

    Getting a guild from a guild ID: ::

    Getting a channel from the guild. If the channel is not found, return None: ::
