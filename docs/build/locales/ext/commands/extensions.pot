msgid "There comes a time in the bot development when you want to extend the bot functionality at run-time and quickly unload and reload code (also called hot-reloading). The command framework comes with this ability built-in, with a concept called **extensions**."

msgid "In this example we define a simple command, and when the extension is loaded this command is added to the bot. Now the final step to this is loading the extension, which we do by calling :meth:`.Bot.load_extension`. To load this extension we call ``bot.load_extension('hello')``."
