msgid "This page gives a brief introduction to the library. It assumes you have the library installed. If you don't, check the :ref:`installing` portion."
msgstr "이 페이지는 라이브러리에 대해 짧게 소개합니다. 라이브러리가 설치돼 있다는 전제하에 진행됩니다. 만약 설치돼 있지 않다면 :ref:`installing` 항목을 확인해 주세요."

msgid "Let's make a bot that responds to a specific message and walk you through it."
msgstr "특정 메시지에 응답하는 봇을 만들어 봅시다. 차근차근 알려 드리겠습니다."

msgid "It looks something like this:"
msgstr "결과는 대강 다음과 같습니다."

msgid "Because this example utilizes message content, it requires the :attr:`Intents.message_content` privileged intent."
msgstr "이 예시는 메시지 콘텐츠를 활용하기 때문에 :attr:`Intents.message_content` 권한이 부여된 인텐트가 필요합니다."

msgid "Let's name this file ``example_bot.py``. Make sure not to name it ``discord.py`` as that'll conflict with the library."
msgstr "이 파일의 이름을 ``example_bot.py``라고 하겠습니다. 파일 이름은 라이브러리와 충돌할 수 있으니 ``discord.py``로 짓지 마세요."

msgstr "많은 일이 일어나고 있으니 하나하나씩 설명해 드리겠습니다."

msgid "The first line just imports the library, if this raises a `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError` then head on over to :ref:`installing` section to properly install."
msgstr "첫째 줄에서는 단순히 라이브러리를 불러옵니다. `ModuleNotFoundError`나 `ImportError`가 발생한다면 :ref:`installing` 항목에서 제대로 설치해 주세요."

msgid "Next, we create an instance of a :class:`Client`. This client is our connection to Discord."

msgid "We then use the :meth:`Client.event` decorator to register an event. This library has many events. Since this library is asynchronous, we do things in a \"callback\" style manner."

msgid "A callback is essentially a function that is called when something happens. In our case, the :func:`on_ready` event is called when the bot has finished logging in and setting things up and the :func:`on_message` event is called when the bot has received a message."

msgid "Since the :func:`on_message` event triggers for *every* message received, we have to make sure that we ignore messages from ourselves. We do this by checking if the :attr:`Message.author` is the same as the :attr:`Client.user`."
