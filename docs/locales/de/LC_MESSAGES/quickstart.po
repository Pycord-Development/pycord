msgid "We then use the :meth:`Client.event` decorator to register an event. This library has many events. Since this library is asynchronous, we do things in a \"callback\" style manner."

msgid "A callback is essentially a function that is called when something happens. In our case, the :func:`on_ready` event is called when the bot has finished logging in and setting things up and the :func:`on_message` event is called when the bot has received a message."
