msgid "What is a coroutine?"
msgstr "What is a coroutine?"

msgid "A |coroutine_link|_ is a function that must be invoked with ``await`` or ``yield from``. When Python encounters an ``await`` it stops the function's execution at that point and works on other things until it comes back to that point and finishes off its work. This allows for your program to be doing multiple things at the same time without using threads or complicated multiprocessing."

msgstr "What does \"blocking\" mean?"

msgid "In asynchronous programming a blocking call is essentially all the parts of the function that are not ``await``. Do not despair however, because not all forms of blocking are bad! Using blocking calls is inevitable, but you must work to make sure that you don't excessively block functions. Remember, if you block for too long then your bot will freeze since it has not stopped the function's execution at that point to do other things."
