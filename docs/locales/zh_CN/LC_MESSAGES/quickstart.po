msgid "This page gives a brief introduction to the library. It assumes you have the library installed. If you don't, check the :ref:`installing` portion."
msgstr "这是一个简短介绍库的页面。假设您已经安装了库。如果你尚未安装，请查看 :ref:`installing`部份。"

msgid "A Minimal Bot"
msgstr "一个精简版的机器人"

msgid "Let's make a bot that responds to a specific message and walk you through it."
msgstr "让我们制作一个机器人来回应特定讯息，并且引导您完成它。"

msgid "It looks something like this:"
msgstr "它看起来像这样："

msgid "Because this example utilizes message content, it requires the :attr:`Intents.message_content` privileged intent."
msgstr "因为这个示例使用到了讯息内容，因此它需要 :attr:`Intents.message_content`网关意图。"

msgid "Let's name this file ``example_bot.py``. Make sure not to name it ``discord.py`` as that'll conflict with the library."
msgstr "让我们将这个档案命名成``example_bot.py``。确保不要将它命名成像是``discord.py``这样会跟库引发冲突的命名。"

msgid "There's a lot going on here, so let's walk you through it step by step:"
msgstr "这里有很多事要做，所以让我们带你一步一步来："

msgid "The first line just imports the library, if this raises a `ModuleNotFoundError` or `ImportError` then head on over to :ref:`installing` section to properly install."
msgstr "在第一行的部份，导入库，如果发生了`ModuleNotFoundError`或者`ImportError`错误，则前往 :ref:`installing` 部份确认安装是否正确。"

msgid "Next, we create an instance of a :class:`Client`. This client is our connection to Discord."
msgstr "接下来，我们创建一个基于 :class:`Client`的实体。这个实体是我们用于跟Discord建立连结的。"

msgid "We then use the :meth:`Client.event` decorator to register an event. This library has many events. Since this library is asynchronous, we do things in a \"callback\" style manner."
msgstr "接着我们使用 :meth:`Client.event` 装饰器去注册一个event。这个库拥有许多event。因为这个库是异步的，所以我们以\"callback\"的风格来做事。"

msgid "A callback is essentially a function that is called when something happens. In our case, the :func:`on_ready` event is called when the bot has finished logging in and setting things up and the :func:`on_message` event is called when the bot has received a message."

msgid "Since the :func:`on_message` event triggers for *every* message received, we have to make sure that we ignore messages from ourselves. We do this by checking if the :attr:`Message.author` is the same as the :attr:`Client.user`."

msgid "Afterwards, we check if the :class:`Message.content` starts with ``'$hello'``. If it does, then we send a message in the channel it was used in with ``'Hello!'``. This is a basic way of handling commands, which can be later automated with the :doc:`./ext/commands/index` framework."

msgid "We then use the :meth:`.Bot.slash_command` decorator to register a new slash command. The ``guild_ids`` attribute contains a list of guilds where this command will be active. If you omit it, the command will be globally available, and may take up to an hour to register."
