"In version 1.5 comes the introduction of :class:`Intents`. This is a "
"radical change in how bots are written. An intent basically allows a bot "
"to subscribe into specific buckets of events. The events that correspond "
"to each intent is documented in the individual attribute of the "
":class:`Intents` documentation."

#: ../../intents.rst:10

"These intents are passed to the constructor of :class:`Client` or its "

"The intents that are necessary for your bot can only be dictated by "

"Due to an :ref:`API change <intents_member_cache>` Discord is now forcing"
" developers who want member caching to explicitly opt-in to it. This is a"
" Discord mandated change and there is no way to bypass it. In order to "
"get members back you have to explicitly enable the :ref:`members "
"privileged intent <privileged_intents>` and change the "
":attr:`Intents.members` attribute to true."

#: ../../intents.rst:172
msgid ""
"As part of the API change regarding intents, Discord also changed how "
"members are loaded in the beginning. Originally the library could request"
" 75 guilds at once and only request members from guilds that have the "
":attr:`Guild.large` attribute set to ``True``. With the new intent "
"changes, Discord mandates that we can only send 1 guild per request. This"
" causes a 75x slowdown which is further compounded by the fact that *all*"
" guilds, not just large guilds are being requested."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intents.rst:174
msgid "There are a few solutions to fix this."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intents.rst:176
msgid ""
"The first solution is to request the privileged presences intent along "
"with the privileged members intent and enable both of them. This allows "
"the initial member list to contain online members just like the old "
"gateway. Note that we're still limited to 1 guild per request but the "
"number of guilds we request is significantly reduced."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intents.rst:178
msgid ""
"The second solution is to disable member chunking by setting "
"``chunk_guilds_at_startup`` to ``False`` when constructing a client. "
"Then, when chunking for a guild is necessary you can use the various "
"techniques to :ref:`retrieve members <retrieving_members>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intents.rst:180
msgid ""
"To illustrate the slowdown caused the API change, take a bot who is in "
"840 guilds and 95 of these guilds are \"large\" (over 250 members)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../intents.rst:182
msgid ""
"Under the original system this would result in 2 requests to fetch the "
"member list (75 guilds, 20 guilds) roughly taking 60 seconds. With "
":attr:`Intents.members` but not :attr:`Intents.presences` this requires "
"840 requests, with a rate limit of 120 requests per 60 seconds means that"
" due to waiting for the rate limit it totals to around 7 minutes of "
"waiting for the rate limit to fetch all the members. With both "
":attr:`Intents.members` and :attr:`Intents.presences` we mostly get the "
"old behaviour so we're only required to request for the 95 guilds that "
"are large, this is slightly less than our rate limit so it's close to the"
" original timing to fetch the member list."

"Unfortunately due to this change being required from Discord there is "
"nothing that the library can do to mitigate this."

"For now, the old gateway will still work so downgrading to pycord "
"v1.4 is still possible and will continue to be supported until Discord "
"officially kills the v6 gateway, which is imminent. However it is "
"paramount that for the future of your bot that you upgrade your code to "
"the new way things are done."
