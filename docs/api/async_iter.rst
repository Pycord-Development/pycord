Async Iterator
==============

Some API functions return an "async iterator". An async iterator is something that is
capable of being used in an :ref:`async for statement <py:async for>`.

These async iterators can be used as follows: ::

    async for elem in channel.history():
        # do stuff with elem here

Certain utilities make working with async iterators easier, detailed below.

.. class:: AsyncIterator

    Represents the "AsyncIterator" concept. Note that no such class exists,
    it is purely abstract.

    .. container:: operations

        .. describe:: async for x in y

            Iterates over the contents of the async iterator.


    .. method:: next()
        :async:

        |coro|

        Advances the iterator by one, if possible. If no more items are found
        then this raises :exc:`NoMoreItems`.

    .. method:: find(predicate)
        :async:

        |coro|

        Similar to :func:`utils.find` except run over the async iterator.

        Unlike :func:`utils.find`\, the predicate provided can be a
        |coroutine_link|_.

        Getting the last audit log with a reason or ``None``: ::

            def predicate(event):
                return event.reason is not None

            event = await guild.audit_logs().find(predicate)

        :param predicate: The predicate to use. Could be a |coroutine_link|_.
        :return: The first element that returns ``True`` for the predicate or ``None``.

    .. method:: flatten()
        :async:

        |coro|

        Flattens the async iterator into a :class:`list` with all the elements.

        :return: A list of every element in the async iterator.
        :rtype: list

    .. method:: chunk(max_size)

        Collects items into chunks of up to a given maximum size.
        Another :class:`AsyncIterator` is returned which collects items into
        :class:`list`\s of a given size. The maximum chunk size must be a positive integer.

        .. versionadded:: 1.6

        Collecting groups of users: ::

            async for leader, *users in reaction.users().chunk(3):
                ...

        .. warning::

            The last chunk collected may not be as large as ``max_size``.

        :param max_size: The size of individual chunks.
        :rtype: :class:`AsyncIterator`

    .. method:: map(func)

        This is similar to the built-in :func:`map <py:map>` function. Another
        :class:`AsyncIterator` is returned that executes the function on
        every element it is iterating over. This function can either be a
        regular function or a |coroutine_link|_.

        Creating a content iterator: ::

            def transform(message):
                return message.content

            async for content in channel.history().map(transform):
                message_length = len(content)

        :param func: The function to call on every element. Could be a |coroutine_link|_.
        :rtype: :class:`AsyncIterator`

    .. method:: filter(predicate)

        This is similar to the built-in :func:`filter <py:filter>` function. Another
        :class:`AsyncIterator` is returned that filters over the original
        async iterator. This predicate can be a regular function or a |coroutine_link|_.

        Getting messages by non-bot accounts: ::

            def predicate(message):
                return not message.author.bot

            async for elem in channel.history().filter(predicate):
                ...

        :param predicate: The predicate to call on every element. Could be a |coroutine_link|_.
        :rtype: :class:`AsyncIterator`
