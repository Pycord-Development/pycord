Event Reference
===============

This section outlines the different types of events listened by :class:`Client`.

There are two ways to register an event, the first way is through the use of
:meth:`Client.event`. The second way is through subclassing :class:`Client` and
overriding the specific events. For example: ::

    import discord

    class MyClient(discord.Client):
        async def on_message(self, message):
            if message.author == self.user:
                return

            if message.content.startswith('$hello'):
                await message.channel.send('Hello World!')


If an event handler raises an exception, :func:`on_error` will be called
to handle it, which defaults to print a traceback and ignoring the exception.

.. warning::

    All the events must be a |coroutine_link|_. If they aren't, then you might get unexpected
    errors. In order to turn a function into a coroutine they must be ``async def``
    functions.

AutoMod
-------
.. function:: on_auto_moderation_rule_create(rule)

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param channel: The guild channel that got created or deleted.
    :type channel: :class:`abc.GuildChannel`

Connection
----------
.. function:: on_error(event, *args, **kwargs)

    Usually when an event raises an uncaught exception, a traceback is
    printed to stderr and the exception is ignored. If you want to
    change this behaviour and handle the exception for whatever reason
    yourself, this event can be overridden. Which, when done, will
    suppress the default action of printing the traceback.

    The information of the exception raised and the exception itself can
    be retrieved with a standard call to :func:`sys.exc_info`.

    If you want exception to propagate out of the :class:`Client` class
    you can define an ``on_error`` handler consisting of a single empty
    :ref:`raise statement <py:raise>`. Exceptions raised by ``on_error`` will not be
    handled in any way by :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        ``on_error`` will only be dispatched to :meth:`Client.event`.

        It will not be received by :meth:`Client.wait_for`, or, if used,
        :ref:`ext_commands_api_bot` listeners such as
        :meth:`~ext.commands.Bot.listen` or :meth:`~ext.commands.Cog.listener`.

    :param event: The name of the event that raised the exception.
    :type event: :class:`str`

    :param args: The positional arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.
    :param kwargs: The keyword arguments for the event that raised the
        exception.

.. function:: on_connect()

    Called when the client has successfully connected to Discord. This is not
    the same as the client being fully prepared, see :func:`on_ready` for that.

    The warnings on :func:`on_ready` also apply.

    .. warning::

        Overriding this event will not call :meth:`Bot.sync_commands`.
        As a result, :class:`ApplicationCommand` will not be registered.

.. function:: on_shard_connect(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_connect` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has connected to Discord.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has connected.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

.. function:: on_disconnect()

    Called when the client has disconnected from Discord, or a connection attempt to Discord has failed.
    This could happen either through the internet being disconnected, explicit calls to close,
    or Discord terminating the connection one way or the other.

    This function can be called many times without a corresponding :func:`on_connect` call.


.. function:: on_shard_disconnect(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_disconnect` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has disconnected from Discord.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has disconnected.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

.. function:: on_ready()

    Called when the client is done preparing the data received from Discord. Usually after login is successful
    and the :attr:`Client.guilds` and co. are filled up.

    .. warning::

        This function is not guaranteed to be the first event called.
        Likewise, this function is **not** guaranteed to only be called
        once. This library implements reconnection logic and thus will
        end up calling this event whenever a RESUME request fails.

.. function:: on_shard_ready(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_ready` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has become ready.

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that is ready.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

.. function:: on_resumed()

    Called when the client has resumed a session.

.. function:: on_shard_resumed(shard_id)

    Similar to :func:`on_resumed` except used by :class:`AutoShardedClient`
    to denote when a particular shard ID has resumed a session.

    .. versionadded:: 1.4

    :param shard_id: The shard ID that has resumed.
    :type shard_id: :class:`int`

.. function:: on_socket_event_type(event_type)

    Called whenever a WebSocket event is received from the WebSocket.

    This is mainly useful for logging how many events you are receiving
    from the Discord gateway.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    :param event_type: The event type from Discord that is received, e.g. ``'READY'``.
    :type event_type: :class:`str`

.. function:: on_socket_raw_receive(msg)

    Called whenever a message is completely received from the WebSocket, before
    it's processed and parsed. This event is always dispatched when a
    complete message is received and the passed data is not parsed in any way.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    This requires setting the ``enable_debug_events`` setting in the :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages received from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param msg: The message passed in from the WebSocket library.
    :type msg: :class:`str`

.. function:: on_socket_raw_send(payload)

    Called whenever a send operation is done on the WebSocket before the
    message is sent. The passed parameter is the message that is being
    sent to the WebSocket.

    This is only really useful for grabbing the WebSocket stream and
    debugging purposes.

    This requires setting the ``enable_debug_events`` setting in the :class:`Client`.

    .. note::

        This is only for the messages sent from the client
        WebSocket. The voice WebSocket will not trigger this event.

    :param payload: The message that is about to be passed on to the
                    WebSocket library. It can be :class:`bytes` to denote a binary
                    message or :class:`str` to denote a regular text message.

Guilds
------
.. function:: on_guild_join(guild)

    Called when a :class:`Guild` is either created by the :class:`Client` or when the
    :class:`Client` joins a guild.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.guilds` to be enabled.

    :param guild: The guild that was joined.
    :type guild: :class:`Guild`

.. function:: on_guild_remove(guild)

    Called when a :class:`Guild` is removed from the :class:`Client`.

    This happens through, but not limited to, these circumstances:

    - The client got banned.
    - The client got kicked.
    - The client left the guild.
    - The client or the guild owner deleted the guild.

    In order for this event to be invoked then the :class:`Client` must have
    been part of the guild to begin with. (i.e. it is part of :attr:`Client.guilds`)

    :type payload: :class:`RawIntegrationDeleteEvent`

Interactions
------------
.. function:: on_interaction(interaction)

    Called when an interaction happened.

    This currently happens due to application command invocations or components being used.

    .. warning::

        This is a low level function that is not generally meant to be used.
        If you are working with components, consider using the callbacks associated
        with the :class:`~discord.ui.View` instead as it provides a nicer user experience.

    .. versionadded:: 2.0

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    .. warning::

        Your bot's own messages and private messages are sent through this
        event. This can lead cases of 'recursion' depending on how your bot was
        programmed. If you want the bot to not reply to itself, consider
        checking the user IDs. Note that :class:`~ext.commands.Bot` does not
        have this problem.

    :param message: The current message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_message_delete(message)

    Called when a message is deleted. If the message is not found in the
    internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_delete` event instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param message: The deleted message.
    :type message: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_bulk_message_delete(messages)

    Called when messages are bulk deleted. If none of the messages deleted
    are found in the internal message cache, then this event will not be called.
    If individual messages were not found in the internal message cache,
    this event will still be called, but the messages not found will not be included in
    the messages list. Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_bulk_message_delete` event instead.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param messages: The messages that have been deleted.
    :type messages: List[:class:`Message`]

.. function:: on_raw_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a message is deleted. Unlike :func:`on_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the message being in the internal message cache or not.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageDeleteEvent.cached_message`

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_raw_bulk_message_delete(payload)

    Called when a bulk delete is triggered. Unlike :func:`on_bulk_message_delete`, this is
    called regardless of the messages being in the internal message cache or not.

    If the messages are found in the message cache,
    they can be accessed via :attr:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent.cached_messages`

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawBulkMessageDeleteEvent`

.. function:: on_message_edit(before, after)

    Called when a :class:`Message` receives an update event. If the message is not found
    in the internal message cache, then these events will not be called.
    Messages might not be in cache if the message is too old
    or the client is participating in high traffic guilds.

    If this occurs increase the :class:`max_messages <Client>` parameter
    or use the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` event instead.

    The following non-exhaustive cases trigger this event:

    - A message has been pinned or unpinned.
    - The message content has been changed.
    - The message has received an embed.

        - For performance reasons, the embed server does not do this in a "consistent" manner.

    - The message's embeds were suppressed or unsuppressed.
    - A call message has received an update to its participants or ending time.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param before: The previous version of the message.
    :type before: :class:`Message`
    :param after: The current version of the message.
    :type after: :class:`Message`

.. function:: on_raw_message_edit(payload)

    Called when a message is edited. Unlike :func:`on_message_edit`, this is called
    regardless of the state of the internal message cache.

    If the message is found in the message cache,
    it can be accessed via :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`. The cached message represents
    the message before it has been edited. For example, if the content of a message is modified and
    triggers the :func:`on_raw_message_edit` coroutine, the :attr:`RawMessageUpdateEvent.cached_message`
    will return a :class:`Message` object that represents the message before the content was modified.

    Due to the inherently raw nature of this event, the data parameter coincides with
    the raw data given by the `gateway <https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#message-update>`_.

    Since the data payload can be partial, care must be taken when accessing stuff in the dictionary.
    One example of a common case of partial data is when the ``'content'`` key is inaccessible. This
    denotes an "embed" only edit, which is an edit in which only the embeds are updated by the Discord
    embed server.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.messages` to be enabled.

    :param payload: The raw event payload data.
    :type payload: :class:`RawMessageUpdateEvent`

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~
.. function:: on_reaction_add(reaction, user)

    Called when a message has a reaction added to it. Similar to :func:`on_message_edit`,
    if the message is not found in the internal message cache, then this
    event will not be called. Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_add` instead.

    .. note::

        To get the :class:`Message` being reacted, access it via :attr:`Reaction.message`.

    This requires :attr:`Intents.reactions` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        This doesn't require :attr:`Intents.members` within a guild context,
        but due to Discord not providing updated user information in a direct message
        it's required for direct messages to receive this event.
        Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_add` if you need this and do not otherwise want
        to enable the members intent.

    :param reaction: The current state of the reaction.

    will not be called.

    .. note::

        To get the message being reacted, access it via :attr:`Reaction.message`.

    This requires both :attr:`Intents.reactions` and :attr:`Intents.members` to be enabled.

    .. note::

        Consider using :func:`on_raw_reaction_remove` if you need this and do not want
        to enable the members intent.

    :param reaction: The current state of the reaction.
    :type reaction: :class:`Reaction`
    :param user: The user who added the reaction.
    :type user: Union[:class:`Member`, :class:`User`]

.. function:: on_raw_reaction_remove(payload)
