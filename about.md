## What is Pycord?
Pycord ("py-cord" on PyPI) is a maintained fork of discord.py which will be updated with new changes to the API. Pycord was created by a group of developers that want to continue developing this Python module.

## Features
Pycord v1.7.3 is the same as discord.py v1.7.3. However Pycord v2.0.0 will support interactions and other features introduced in discord.py v2.0.0a as it's a fork of the master branch. <br>
